# Prep
This workshop is not Your First Git Repository.
To get the most out of it, you should know how to do the basic everyday
git operations: init, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge.
If you've not used git before, consider spending an hour:
* [Install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Work through Lab 10 or farther in [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)
